# TODO: What happens to original when you iterate a modified stream?
class Stream:
    """Stream class.

    Lets you iterate and aggregate over anything that's iterable, using a
    "fluent" interface.  Any Stream object wraps a sequence of items.

    Streams are iterated lazily except where specified.  So nothing happens
    and your callbacks are not called, until you actually do something to
    pull values from your stream.  A stream will not read all of its items
    into memory at once, which can be useful for large data sets, and it
    won't call any of the functions you pass on items until it really has to.
    You can even have infinite streams, such as one that generates digits of Pi
    on demand.

    It also means that you can't just call e.g. `map` or `filter` with a
    function that does something, and expect it to operate on all your items.
    Your function only gets called as an item is actually read from the stream.
    There's a `drain` method for "go through all items now."

    This is an example of a "terminal" operation: it tries to read all items
    right away, instead of iterating them one by one.  Usually the operations
    that return a stream are non-terminal, meaning they continue to iterate
    lazily.  Operations that don't return a stream are usually terminal.  For
    instance, if you ask for the sum of the elements in a stream, the operation
    is going to have to read all of the items right there.

    Sometimes a terminal operation doesn't really consume all items in the
    stream.  It may stop if a function you passed raises an exception.  But in
    other cases, the operation can simply complete early.  For example, the
    "all" method can stop as soon as it hits a False item.

    Many methods take both a function and a "kwargs" as parameters.  That's
    shorthand for parameter binding.  To avoid confusion with positional
    arguments, it binds only keyword arguments.

    The kwargs trick can save you some hard-to-read antics.  For instance, if
    you have a sequence of lists and you want to sort them all in reverse
    order, you can pass the "reverse=True" parameter to each call:

        stream.map(sorted, {'reverse': True})
